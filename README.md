# theoretical_informatics
Assignments for the Theoretical Informatics course I took in Free University of Tbilisi.\
The topic is state machines.\
First assignment is about parsing a given regular expression and converting it into a Deterministic Finite Automaton(first part), which can then be run by the second part of the assignment.\
Second assignment is about converting a given dual-taped Turing Machine into a single-Taped(standard) one(first part), which can then be run by the second part of the assignment.
